    "content": "Semver This project tries to follow the semver policy - although not followed 100% in the past.\nUsually an entry of Breaking on the What’s new page causes a new major release number.\nAll other entries on the What’s new page will increase the minor release number.\nReleases resulting in a new major or minor number are called main release.\nReleases containing bugixes only, are only increasing the patch release number. Those releases don’t result in announcements on the What’s new page.\nEntries on the What’s new page are checked and enforced during the version-release GitHub Action.\nManaging Issues Issues are categorized and managed by assigning labels to it.\nOnce working on an issue, assign it to a fitting maintainer.\nWhen done, close the ticket. Once an issue is closed, it needs to be assigned to next release milestone.\nA once released ticket is not allowed to be reopened and rereleased in a different milestone. This would cause the changelog to be changed even for the milestone the issue was previously released in. Instead write a new ticket.\nManaging Pull Requests If a PR is merged and closed it needs an accompanied issue assigned to. If there is no issue for a PR, the maintainer needs to create one.\nYou can assign multiple PRs to one issue as long as they belong together.\nUsually set the same labels and milestone for the PR as for the accompanied issue.\nLabels Kind An issue that results in changesets must have exactly one of the following labels. This needs to be assigned latest before release.\nLabel Description Changelog section documentation Improvements or additions to documentation - discussion This issue was converted to a discussion - task Maintainence work Maintenance feature New feature or request Features bug Something isn’t working Fixes Impact If the issue would cause a new main release due to semver semantics it needs one of the according labels and the matching badge on the What’s new page.\nLabel Description change Introduces changes with existing installations breaking Introduces breaking changes with existing installations Declination If an issue does not result in changesets but is closed anyways, it must have exactly one of the following labels.\nLabel Description duplicate This issue or pull request already exists invalid This doesn’t seem right support Solved by reconfiguring the authors site unresolved No progress on this issue update A documented change in behaviour wontfix This will not be worked on Halt You can assign one further label out of the following list to signal readers that development on an open issue is currently halted for different reasons.\nLabel Description blocked Depends on other issue to be fixed first idea A valuable idea that’s currently not worked on undecided No decission was made yet helpwanted Great idea, send in a PR needsfeedback Further information is needed 3rd-Party If the issue is not caused by a programming error in the themes own code, you can label the causing program or library.\nLabel Description browser This is a topic related to the browser but not the theme device This is a topic related to a certain device hugo This is a topic related to Hugo itself but not the theme mermaid This is a topic related to Mermaid itself but not the theme Making Releases A release is based on a milestone named like the release itself - just the version number, eg: 1.2.3. It’s in the maintainers responsiblity to check semver semantics of the milestone’s name prior to release and change it if necessary.\nMaking releases is automated by the version-release GitHub Action. It requires the version number of the milestone that should be released. The release will be created from the main branch of the repository.\nTreat released milestones as immutable. Don’t rerelease an already released milestone. An already released milestone may already been consumed by your users.\nDuring execution of the action a few things are checked. If a check fails the action fails, resulting in no new release. You can correct the errors afterwards and rerun the action.\nThe following checks will be enforced\nthe milestone exists there is at least one closed issue assigned to the milestone all assigned issues for this milestone are closed if it’s a main release, there must be a new \u003cmajor\u003e.\u003cminor\u003e at the beginning of the What’s new page if it’s a patch release, there must be the \u003cmajor\u003e.\u003cminor\u003e from the previous release at the beginning of the What’s new page After a successful run of the action\nthe History page is updated, including release version, release date and text the What’s new page is updated, including release version, release date and text the version number for the \u003cmeta generator\u003e is updated the updated files are commited the milestone is closed the repository is tagged with the version number (eg. 1.2.3), the main version number (eg. 1.2.x) and the major version number (eg. 1.x) a new entry in the GitHub release list with the according changelog will be created the official documentation is built and deployed the version number for the \u003cmeta generator\u003e is updated to a temporary and commited (this helps to determine if users are running directly on the main branch or are using releases) a new milestone for the next patch release is created (this can later be renamed to a main release if necessary) ",
